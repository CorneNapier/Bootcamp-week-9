"""use a while loop when the number of iteration is unknown(dont know how many times you want/going 
to do something for)
A while loop also controls the flow of execution in a program"""


num = 20  # Initialize num to 20

while num >= 1:  # Continue the loop until num is greater than or equal to 1
    print(num)
    num -= 1  # Decrement num by 1 in each iteration


"To Do: Explain what is += 1  ?"
# += 1 means to increment the variable by 1
# -= 1 means to decrement the variable by 1

"To Do: Task 2: Modify the whileloop above to count down from 20 to 1 and comment your code"
